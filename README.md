# Machine-learning-Based-Approaches-for-Livestock-Symptoms-and-Diseases-Prediction-and-Classification
Developed and implemented machine learning models for predicting and classifying livestock disease,Achieved 83.5% accuracy using Random Forest.
Livestock animals, often kept is isolated areas with limited medical access, require effective disease management to prevent outbreaks.
Rapid and accurate disease diagnosis is crucial to control the spread of disease among livestock.
A system using machine learning is proposed to predict livestock disease based on symptoms and recommend preventive measures.
The study uses a dataset with variables such a age, symptoms, temperature variations, and disease type to predict disease.
Eight machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, Light Gradient Boost, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
